Please see [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) for a list of recent changes. (huge performance improvements!)

Introduction
------------

The [browscap.ini](http://tempdownloads.browserscap.com/) file is a
database was maintained by [Gary Keith](https://github.com/GaretJax/) and is 
now maintained by [RAD Moose](https://plus.google.com/u/0/114247395634091389252/).
More information about the transfer of owners can be found here: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/browscap/pk_dkkqdXzg
The [browscap.ini](http://tempdownloads.browserscap.com/), which,
provides a lot of details about browsers and their capabilities, such as name,
versions, Javascript support and so on.

PHP's native [get_browser()](http://php.net/get_browser) function parses this
file and provides you with a complete set of information about every browser's
details, But it requires the path to the browscap.ini file to be specified in
the php.ini [browscap](http://ch2.php.net/manual/en/ref.misc.php#ini.browscap)
directive which is flagged as `PHP_INI_SYSTEM`.

Since in most shared hosting environments you have not access to the php.ini
file, the browscap directive cannot be modified and you are stuck with either
and outdated database or without browscap support at all.

Browscap is a standalone class for PHP >=5.3 that gets around the limitations of
`get_browser()` and manages the whole thing.
It offers methods to update, cache, adapt and get details about every supplied
user agent on a standalone basis.

Browscap is a [Composer](http://packagist.org/about-composer) package.


Browscap is currently running on a temporary site (http://tempdownloads.browserscap.com/)
while some things are sorted out and redone after a change of owners. For more
