_Hacking around with PHP to have a better solution than `get_browser()`_

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/GaretJax/phpbrowscap.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/GaretJax/phpbrowscap)


Changes (new version - 2.0)
-------

Please see [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) for a list of recent changes. (huge performance improvements!) 


Introduction
------------

The [browscap.ini](http://tempdownloads.browserscap.com/) file is a database which
provides a lot of details about browsers and their capabilities, such as name,
versions, Javascript support and so on.

_Please note: [browscap.ini](http://tempdownloads.browserscap.com/) was maintained by [Gary Keith](https://github.com/GaryKeith) and is 
now maintained by [RAD Moose](https://github.com/radmoose). More information about the transfer of owners can be found [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/browscap/pk_dkkqdXzg)._
Browscap.ini source files are now officially available at http://browscap.org/.
All the links in `Browscap` class are updated, but if you use custom links remember to change them!

PHP's native [get_browser()](http://php.net/get_browser) function parses this
file and provides you with a complete set of information about every browser's
details, But it requires the path to the browscap.ini file to be specified in
the php.ini [browscap](http://ch2.php.net/manual/en/ref.misc.php#ini.browscap)
directive which is flagged as `PHP_INI_SYSTEM`.

Since in most shared hosting environments you have not access to the php.ini
file, the browscap directive cannot be modified and you are stuck with either
and outdated database or without browscap support at all.

Browscap is a standalone class for PHP >=5.3 that gets around the limitations of
`get_browser()` and manages the whole thing.
It offers methods to update, cache, adapt and get details about every supplied
user agent on a standalone basis.
It's also much faster than `get_browser()` while still returning the same results.

Browscap is a [Composer](http://packagist.org/about-composer) package.
